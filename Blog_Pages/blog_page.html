					<p>Hello dear readers! Today, I will provide you with important information based
						on scientific data about newborn baby health. The newborn period is a moment
						of great transformation in the baby's life and it is necessary to take important
						steps for a healthy start. Here are some important points you should know:

						<strong style="font-size:large ;">1. Breastfeeding:</strong> Scientific research emphasizes the importance
						of breast milk, which is best for babies. Breast milk strengthens babies' immune
						systems, reduces the risk of infection and provides the right nutrients. The American
						Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends that babies should be exclusively breastfed for
						at least six months. Breastfeeding also strengthens the mother-infant bond and helps babies grow and develop healthily.
					</p>

					<blockquote>
						<p>"Breast milk naturally contains antibodies, enzymes, immune cells and other
							important components. These components support the baby's immune system and protect against diseases.
							In addition, breastfed babies have a lower risk of immune-related conditions such as allergies and asthma."</p>

					<p> <strong style="font-size:large ;">2. Nutrition:</strong> The intestinal system of newborn babies is not yet fully mature. It is therefore 
						important that they are fed breast milk or formula. Breast milk provides the nutrients the baby
						needs and strengthens the immune system. Breast milk is also easy to digest and supports the baby's
						intestinal health. If breast milk is not enough or breastfeeding is not possible, you can use a formula
						recommended by your doctor. It is important to seek the support of your pediatrician or a nutritionist
						to ensure that your diet is correct and balanced.

							<strong style="font-size:large ;">3. Sleep Patterns:</strong> Newborn babies may not have established sleep patterns yet. Babies usually need to be
							fed every 2-3 hours and may wake up frequently. Providing them with a regular sleep environment and
							establishing sleep routines can help your baby rest better. One study has shown that a regular sleep
							schedule for newborn babies supports cognitive development and makes them less cranky.

							<strong style="font-size:large ;">4. Immune System:</strong> The immune system of newborn babies is still developing.
							Therefore, it is important to take precautions to protect babies from infections. Keep your baby away from crowded 
							places with many strangers, keep hands clean and follow the immunization schedule regularly. Studies show that breastfeeding
							strengthens babies' immune systems by providing them with antibodies from their mothers.

							<strong style="font-size:large ;">5. Skin System:</strong> Skin Care: The skin of newborn babies is sensitive and thin. It is
							important to clean their skin with natural and non-irritating products. Avoiding products containing perfume and alcohol can help
							keep your baby's skin healthy. A study by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) found that frequent bathing and use of skin products
							can cause dry skin in babies. To clean babies' skin, it is <u>enough to use a mild baby soap or just water</u>. Also, keeping the baby's bottom
							area clean and dry at every diaper change prevents irritation.
