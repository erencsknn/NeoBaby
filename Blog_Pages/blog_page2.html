					<div class="blog-text">
					<p>"Pregnancy is one of the most magical and exciting times in a woman's life. However, it is also extremely
						important to protect the health of the expectant mother during this period. Scientific research shows that
						making the right choices during pregnancy positively affects both the health of the mother and the health
						of the baby. In this blog post, we will take a look at the key steps based on scientific evidence to protect
						maternal health during pregnancy. If you're ready, read on to discover the important information you need for a healthy pregnancy.

						<strong style="font-size:large ;">1. A Balanced and Nutritious Diet:</strong> During pregnancy, a nutritious diet is important to
						meet the needs of mother and baby. It is important to consume a balanced diet that includes essential nutrients such as protein,
						iron, calcium, folic acid and vitamin D. Fresh fruits and vegetables, whole grains, protein sources (fish, chicken, eggs, legumes),
						milk and dairy products should form the basis of nutrition during this period.
					</p>

					<blockquote>
						<p>"Recent research has shown that a balanced and nutritious diet during pregnancy has important effects on the health of mother and baby.
							A 2018 study found that when pregnant women consume a diet with adequate amounts of protein, iron, calcium, folic acid and vitamin D,
							it increases the baby's birth weight and reduces the risk of birth defects."</p>

					<p> <strong style="font-size:large ;">2. Sport:</strong> More and more research is supporting the importance of exercising during pregnancy.
						Regular physical activity has many benefits for a healthy pregnancy. A 2017 study showed that women who exercised regularly during
						pregnancy had a lower risk of obesity and controlled their pregnancy weight more effectively (Ruchat et al., 2017).
						It has also been found that mothers who exercise regularly have a lower incidence of conditions such as birth complications,
						gestational diabetes and hypertension.

						<p>
							Another important benefit of exercising during pregnancy is its positive effect on mood.
								Research shows that regular exercise increases the release of endorphins, reducing stress and alleviating symptoms of
								depression. Exercising to balance the emotional fluctuations that can occur with the hormonal changes during pregnancy
								can help the expectant mother feel happier and more energized. 
						</p>

						<blockquote>
							<p>"A 2018 study showed that women who exercise regularly generally have a shorter labor duration and are more likely to have a vaginal delivery (Haakstad et al., 2018).
								 Exercise helps strengthen the pelvic muscles and contributes to more effective contractions during labor."</p>

						<p>
							<strong> However, there are some factors to consider when practicing sports during pregnancy. </strong> First, it "s important to get your doctor "s approval.
							Since every woman's pregnancy is different, you should consult your doctor to determine how appropriate it is to play sports. Also, excessive
							exercise should be avoided and rest should be taken when discomfort occurs. Sports that require balance and contact sports should be avoided
							to reduce the risk of falls. You should also wear appropriate clothing and ensure adequate hydration to maintain your body's temperature regulation.

							When assessing the benefits of exercising during pregnancy, you should also consider your personal limits and comfort. If you have never exercised
							regularly before or have any health problems, you should consult your doctor before starting a new exercise program. By exercising in a safe and
							comfortable way, you can support both body and soul during pregnancy.
