              Fear of what other people will think is the single most paralyzing dynamic in business and in life.
              The best moment of my life was the day I realized that I no longer give a damn what anybody thinks. 
              That’s enormously liberating and freeing, and it’s the only way to live your life and do your business<br><br><br>

              You can't connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards. 
              So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. 
              You have to trust in something--your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever. 
              This approach has never let me down, 
              and it has made all the difference in my life.<br><br><br>

              Would you like me to give you a formula for success? It’s quite simple, 
              really: Double your rate of failure. 
              You are thinking of failure as the enemy of success. 
              But it isn’t at all. You can be discouraged by failure or you can learn from it, 
              so go ahead and make mistakes. Make all you can. Because remember, that’s where you will find success

              Work hard for what you want because it won’t come to you without a fight. 
              You have to be strong and courageous and know that you can do anything you put your mind to. 
              If somebody puts you down or criticizes you, 
              just keep on believing in yourself and turn it into something positive.

              One, remember to look up at the stars and not down at your feet. 
              Two, never give up work. Work gives you meaning and purpose and life is empty without it. 
              Three, if you are lucky enough to find love, remember it is there and don’t throw it away.

              The adventure of life is to learn. The purpose of life is to grow. 
              The nature of life is to change. The challenge of life is to overcome. 
              The essence of life is to care. The opportunity of life is to serve. 
              The secret of life is to dare. The spice of life is to befriend. 
              The beauty of life is to give.

              Stay true to yourself, yet always be open to learn. 
              Work hard, and never give up on your dreams, even when nobody else believes they can come true but you. 
              These are not cliches but real tools you need no matter what you do in life to stay focused on your path.

              Take up one idea. Make that one idea your life--think of it, 
              dream of it, live on that idea. Let the brain, muscles, nerves, every part of your body,
              be full of that idea, and just leave every other idea alone. 
              This is the way to success.

              Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. 
              And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven't found it yet, keep looking. Don't settle.
              As with all matters of the heart, you'll know when you find it.

              Life is not about finding yourself.
              Life is about creating yourself. 
              If I had my life to live over, instead of wishing away nine months of pregnancy, 
              I’d have cherished every moment and realized that the wonderment 
              growing inside me was the only chance in life to assist God in a miracle.

              Be an encourager: When you encourage others, you boost their self-esteem, 
              enhance their self-confidence, make them work harder, lift their spirits and make them successful in their endeavors. 
              Encouragement goes straight to the heart and is always available. 
              Be an encourager. Always.

              Sometimes, when you pick up your child,
               you can feel the map of your own bones beneath your hands, 
               or smell the scent of your skin in the nape of his neck. 
               This is the most extraordinary thing about motherhood ‒ finding a piece of yourself separate and apart, 
               that all the same, you could not live without.
